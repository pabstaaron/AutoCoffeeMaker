      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Imagine having a machine that would allow you to have the perfect cup of coffee right in your own home or office, without
        ever having to trek to the coffee shop. A machine that allows you to specify exactly how you like your coffee with
        exacting detail and optional scheduling at which point it will flawlessly produce that beverage for you. A machine
        that can recommend new beverages based on your, and other users’ past preferences.</p>

      <p> There are plenty of machines on the market that claim to be fully automatic, but none are capable of going all the
        way from raw ingredients to a finished beverage without any intervention from the user. With current fully-automatic
        machines, the user still has to manually froth milk and dispense flavoring syrup; the machine only handles the grinding,
        tamping, and brewing tasks. These machines also provide a very limited scope of control to the user, giving them
        only a few options for dictating how they would like their coffee to be made. Finally, most of these machines have
        very limited user interfaces and few have an option for remote control from a more user friendly device, such as
        a smartphone or tablet.
      </p>

      <p>Our product differs by focusing on automation, personalization, and user-friendliness above all else. Our machine will
        house all ingredients internally, receive instructions wirelessly, and will have an automatic cleaning mechanism.
        The minimization of human interaction allows us to have complete control of the brewing and mixing process, allowing
        us to make a consistent cup of coffee. This also allows us to operate the machine wirelessly, allowing for streamlined
        UI capabilities and scheduled events. Autonomous control allows you to monitor the machine’s use, personal consumption
        habits, and ingredient consumption, while also giving the user the ability to tweak individual settings to make a
        personalized and reproducible cup of coffee. The machine itself will consist of a series of boilers, chillers, and
        pumps as well as a specially designed chamber for automatically frothing milk. These components will be driven from
        custom heater and chiller control circuitry as well as an embedded linux controller. The physical device will be
        backed by some remote user-interface and a database for storing ingredient information and user data.</p>
