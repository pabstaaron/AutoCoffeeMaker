\begin{abstract}
Imagine having a machine that would allow you to make the perfect cup of coffee
right in your own home or office, without ever having to trek to the coffee
shop. A machine that allows you to specify exactly how you like your coffee
with exacting detail and optional scheduling at which point it will flawlessly
produce that beverage for you. A machine that can recommend new beverages based
on your and other users’ past preferences.

There are plenty of machines on the market that claim to be fully automatic,
but none are capable of going all the way from raw ingredients to a finished
beverage without any intervention from the user. With these
machines, the user still has to manually froth milk dispense flavoring
syrup, and mix the beverage themselves; the machine only handles the grinding,
tamping, and brewing tasks.
These machines also provide a very limited scope of control to the user, giving them
only a few options for dictating how they would like their coffee to be
produced.
Finally, most of these machines have very limited user interfaces and few have
an option for remote control from a more user friendly device, such as a
smartphone or tablet.

Our product differs by focusing on automation, personalization, and
user-friendliness above all else. Our machine will house all ingredients
internally, receive instructions wirelessly, and will have an automatic
cleaning mechanism. The minimization of human interaction allows us to have
complete control of the brewing and mixing process, allowing us to make a
consistent cup of coffee. This also allows us to operate the machine
wirelessly, allowing for streamlined UI capabilities and scheduled events.
Autonomous control allows you to monitor the machine’s use, personal
consumption habits, and ingredient consumption, while also giving the user the
ability to tweak individual settings to make a personalized and reproducible
cup of coffee. The machine itself will consist of a series of boilers,
chillers, and pumps as well as a specially designed chamber for automatically
frothing milk. These components will be driven from custom heater and chiller
control circuitry as well as an embedded linux controller. The physical device
will be backed by some remote user-interface and a database for storing
ingredient information and user data.
