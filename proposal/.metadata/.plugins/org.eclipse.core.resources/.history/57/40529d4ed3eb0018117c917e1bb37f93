% Imagine having a machine that would allow you to make the perfect cup of coffee
% right in your own home or office, without ever having to trek to the coffee
% shop. A machine that allows you to specify exactly how you like your coffee
% with exacting detail and optional scheduling at which point it will flawlessly
% produce that beverage for you. A machine that can recommend new beverages based
% on your and other users past preferences.
% 
% There are plenty of machines on the market that claim to be fully automatic,
% but none are capable of going all the way from raw ingredients to a finished
% beverage without any intervention from the user. With these
% machines, the user still has to manually froth milk, dispense flavoring
% syrup, and mix the beverage themselves; the machine only handles the grinding,
% tamping, and brewing tasks.
% These machines also provide a very limited scope of control to the user, giving them
% only a few options for dictating how they would like their coffee to be
% produced.
% Finally, most of these machines have very limited user interfaces and few have
% an option for remote control from a more user friendly device, such as a
% smart phone or tablet.
% 
% Our product differs by focusing on automation, personalization, and
% user-friendliness above all else. Our machine will house all ingredients
% internally, receive instructions wirelessly, and will have an automatic
% cleaning mechanism. The minimization of human interaction allows us to have
% complete control of the brewing and mixing process, allowing us to make a
% consistent cup of coffee. This also allows us to operate the machine
% wirelessly, allowing for streamlined UI capabilities and scheduled events.
% Autonomous control allows you to monitor the machine’s use, personal
% consumption habits, and ingredient consumption, while also giving the user the
% ability to tweak individual settings to make a personalized and reproducible
% cup of coffee. The machine itself will consist of a series of boilers,
% chillers, and pumps as well as a specially designed chamber for automatically
% frothing milk. These components will be driven from custom heater and chiller
% control circuitry as well as an embedded Linux controller. The physical device
% will be backed by some remote user-interface and a database for storing

Making espresso is difficult. It takes several pieces of bulky equipment and a
lot of practice to consistently get right. However, most of the difficult tasks
involved in the espresso making process can be automated in a way that is predictable and
consistent. There are several machines on the market that do successfully
automate the process, but none of these machines make espresso in the same way that
skilled baristas do and the quality of the output reflects this. By creating a
machine that mimics a human barista, these automatic espresso machines can be
superseded.

\section{Introduction} 

There are many espresso machines available for commercial and
consumer applications. The most frequent of which an average consumer will
encounter is the manual espresso machine used by their local coffee shop. These
machines require a substantial amount of training and practice to wield
effectively. The operator must master the skills of grinding the coffee, tamping
grounds, and physically pulling the espresso; tasks that are out of reach for
the average consumer to perform on their own.

However, there are an increasing number of espresso machines on the market that
automate some of this process.  Most of these machines grind beans, tamp the
grounds, and pull the espresso with little intervention from the user. However,
the quality of these machines often trails behind that produced by a human
barista.
 
There is not presently an elegantly implemented solution for an
automated espresso machine that mimics the way a human would make espresso. This
is largely due to the fact that there are certain mechanisms and control 
systems that would have to be created for such a device that are non-trivial to design and implement.

The remainder of this document discusses the functionality of various 
modern coffee machines. We then compare our implementation of a fully
automated, web connected espresso machine. This discussion will include a
detailed description of how the device was designed and implemented.

\subsection{How Espresso Machines Work}
% TODO there may be some light plagerism in this section..

There are many different types of coffee makers available. Each of these systems
is unique in its own way and each has its pro's and con's. All coffee makers,
however, have one thing in common: they all must push hot water through ground
coffee beans in some way. In the case of espresso, hot water is heated to a near
boiling temperature and pressurized in some way. This hot water is then forced
through densely packed coffee grounds (known as a ``puck'') in order to produce
a thick, creamy coffee \cite{wikiespresso}.  

There are several different ways in which the water may be pressurized. One of
the most common ways this is accomplished is to simply let the water pressurize
as it heats in a sealed container and turns into steam. Once a suitable
temperature is reached, the container is unsealed and the pressurized water
passes through the puck. This approach is used in most low-end espresso machines
as it requires few mechanical components and is generally inexpensive. It also
tends to produce lower quality espresso as the water pressure is difficult to
regulate and drops as the brewing cycle progresses.

Higher end machines used in most commercial applications use an electric pump to
force the water through the grounds, allowing for tighter control of the
water pressure as well as faster brewing times.

An optional, but important, component of an espresso machine is the frothing
wand. The frothing wand is a hollow shaft of aluminum that is used to direct
high pressure steam into milk (or a milk-like product), the effect of which is
incorporating air into the milk that makes it light and foamy (or frothy, as
the name suggests). Most modern espresso machines have a built-in frothing
mechanism. On lower end machines, the frothing wand connects to the same boiler
that produces the brewing water. This is undesirable due to the fact that
frothing water needs to be heated to much higher temperatures than brewing water
in order to produce the necessary high pressure steam. Machines that only have a
single boiler therefore need to introduce a long delay between the brewing and
frothing cycle while the boiler switches from one task to another.

Higher-end machines will generally introduce a second boiler for producing
frothing steam. This boiler will operate at a much higher temperature than the
brewing boiler in order to produce the necessary steam pressure.


% In-depth write up of how the project was completed
\section{Project Implementation}
The project was completed in three main parts. The design and construction of an
automatic dispensing/grinding/brewing system, the creation of embedded C++ to
control this mechanical system, and an Android application to provide a user
interface.

\subsection{Design Decisions}
Our implementation utilizes a single boiler to heat water. Water is
pressurized and moved though this boiler using an alternating current vibratory
pump, found in many home esspresso machines. This pump and boiler setup does not
provide good control over the output water pressure, but is cheap and accessible
with the boiler and pump being salavgable from lower end home espresso machines.

\subsection{The Brewing Process}
The brewing mechanism consists of the three primary stages, a dispensing and
tamping phase, a brewing phase, and a disposing phase. The mechanism is
centered around a custom designed espresso puck that is mounted to a
sliding rail. During the tamping phase grounds are dispensed from a receptacle
sitting above a waterwheel type mechanism controlled by a stepper motor. As the
wheel spins, ground coffee is dumped onto a chute that directs the coffee to
spill into the puck. After a sufficent amount of grounds have been dispensed, an
actuator presses down into the puck to compress the coffee grounds. At this
point, the puck is slid over via a stepper motor to sit underneath a boiler
salvaged from an existing espresso machine. The boiler is heated to a defined
set temprature and then a pump is activated to begin moving water through the
boiler. The amount of water moved is monitored using a hall-effect based flow
meter. Once a suffiecent amount of water has been dispensed, the puck is moved
to sit under another actuator, which punches the grounds out of the puck and
into a waste container.

% TODO - Add renders and pictures here
\subsection{Mechanical Design and Implementation}
All of the design work for the machine was completed in the Fusion 360 CAD
package. This design was then fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and
laser cutting. 

Initially, the brewing mechanism was designed by drawing all components as
floating objects with no housing or support. Once the mechanism was designed and
simulating properly, shelves were drawn under and behind the pieces to support
the components. All mechanical pieces that couldn't be readily purchased
(everything except motors and acutators) were 3D printed in PETG, which has good
mechanical properties and is generally considered food safe in and of itself
(although fused deposition printing is not an FDA approved process). The
housing/support components were then fabricated out of quarter inch acrylic using a laser cutter.

The custom mechanical components consist of a puck, tampers, a ground dispensing
wheel, a chute for directing the grounds, motor mounts, and acutator mounts. The
purchased componets included NEMA-17 stepper motors, linear servos (actuators),
linear bearings, rails, rail mounts, and a timing belt.

Once all pieces were fabricated, the acrylic housing was assembled using five
minute epoxy. All mechanical pieces were then bolted into their approprate place
and the timing belt was installed and tensioned between the stepper motor and
the puck.

At this point, not all of the components lined up with each other as initally
designed due to the kerf of the laser cutter and assembly errors. Some mounting
holes needed to be redone with a drill. Additionally, some of the pieces were
altered after the acrylic housing was cut, so some mounting positions had to be
manually opended with a drill.

    \caption{Thermocouple amplifier with 100Hz low-pass filter.}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Electronics and Control}
The electronics for the system were intially designed as a custom PCB that would
be responsible for all low-level control tasks. This PCB would communicate over
UART with a Raspberry Pi 3 for WiFi control.

Due to outstanding issues with the motor control circutry, the system was
redesigned to replace the custom PCB with an Adafruit Feather board along with
accessories that provided equivalent functionality to what the original PCB was
designed for. In many cases, these accessories use components idential to those
used in the original PCB.

The electrical system consists for the following major blocks: stepper motor
controllers, PWM servo controllers, a temperature sensor, relays, a liquid flow
meter, and several homing switches.

The stepper motor controller is an Adafruit Motor Controller Featherwing. This
controller uses a TB6613 H-bridge chip along with the Arduino stepper motor
library to control the stepper. We additionally added a library (AccelStepper)
between the stepper motor library and the control chip for moving the stepper motor with
acceleration and decceleration. We needed acceleration on the stepper movements
for the puck in order to achieve an accurate positioning.

Mechanisms involving stepper motors generally have a certain point that is
considered to be a starting, or home, position. However, the starting position
of the mechanism may not necessarily be known. Therefore, the mechanism must be
``homed,'' that is, the starting position must be found. We accomplish this task
in the tamp/brew/dispose mechanism using two microswitches on either end of
the device. On startup, the puck is moved slowly to the tamper side of the
device until it runs into one of these homing switches. This position is noted and the
motor moves to the disposer side of the machine until a switch on that end is
hit, this positon is also noted. It's important that we have accurate positons
on both ends of the mechanism in order to ensure that the tamper and disposer
are accuratly positioned above the puck.

The temperature sensor is used to regulate the water temprature in the boiler
during the brewing process. The sensor consists of thermocouple with an AD8494
temperature sensing amplifer. A thermocouple is a device that produces a small
voltage depending on the temperature it is exposed to. This voltage is too small
for most microcontrollers to detect, so it must be amplified. The AD8494 takes
the thermocouple voltage and amplifies it such that the output of the device is
5mV per degree celsius.

A liquid flow meter was used to monitor the amount of fluid being moved through
the pump. This sensor has a pinwheel with a magnet and a hall effect sensor. As
fluid flow through the sensor the pinwheel spins, causing the magnet to move
over the hall effect sensor, generating a digital pulse. Each pulse equates to
roughly 2.2mL of fluid. This signal was setup to trigger an interrupt in the
microcontroller. Each time this interrupt is generated, a counter keeping track
of how much fluid has been dispensed is incremented.

When the system is started, the machine runs through a startup check in which
all motors and acutators are twitched in order to verify correct functionality.
The homing procedure defined above is then performed. The machine will then move
the puck back to the tamping position and wait until a brew command is received
over UART. When this command is received, the machine drives the motors and
acuators to perfrom the brewing process defined above. During the actual brewing
phase of the process, relays are used to turn on and off the boiler and pump as
descrived in the mechanical design section. When the process is complete, the
puck is returned to the home position and the cycle repeats.

% TODO This section should probably go after the flash section
\subsection{Raspberry Pi Setup and Initialization}
%TODO Actually build up and run http://mattrichardson.com/Raspberry-Pi-Flask/ on a flask server
% and right down the steps for setup. Setup should be very similar

 
%TODO This is written as if there will be microcontroller in conjunction with
% the RPI. I don't think that will wind up being the case - Aaron
% ADDENDUM I'm starting to think maybe that's not such a bad idea - Aaron
% ADDENDUM ADDENDUM We're using a seprate micro with the Pi.. - Aaron
\subsection{Flask}
Flask is a web framework that provides tools to allow you to build a web application.
Flask is a micro-framework, so it requires no outside dependencies or external libraries.
This means that Flask is lightweight. Flask is designed for creating web applications,
with a database backend that operates through the browser. We will be using it to open
a port on the local WiFi network that will act as a REST server. We will use
this server to send commands through the Raspberry Pi to the microcontroller. Thus, Flask is a middleman from the 
android application and the components inside the coffee machine.

\subsection{Mobile Application}
The UI will be implemented as an Android application written in Java. Upon
opening the application, it will ask the user to pair their Android device to
the coffee machine given it's serial number. Afterwards, it will take the user
to a login screen which will give the user the option of registering.
Registering and implementing a database is a stretch goal, our first
priority is a simple UI that functions well with the machine.

For registration, the idea is that we will allow the user to have a few extra options given from a database
integration. These options will allow the user to search recent beverage
choices, favorites, recommendations, schedules, and an online database. Each
menu will include a similar list layout with searchable drinks. Upon clicking
one of the listed items, it will show all of the settings and have descriptions
based on what the user (whether it is yourself or another user) has written. It
will then provide the option of favoriting, brewing, and scheduling the drink
right in that given screen. In the scheduling menu, drink schedules may be
canceled or changed. Registering will allow a user to login on
any application and have all of the features described above.

Given the choice of not creating a login, which is our base goal, a user will still have to pair their
phone to the device through the database, but won't have to deal with any extra
UI that comes with a registered user. A non-registered user will be allowed to
brew coffee the way they want at that instant. 

For the beverage creation menu, there will be advanced and basic settings options, allowing the user to be very
precise in their beverage creation. Once all settings are selected, if
registered, a user may have the decision to leave information on the drink
created and post it in a searchable database and/or their recents/favorites.
If the user is not registered, it will not prompt them for anything and brew their drink. 

The mobile application
will have the job of communicating between the FLASK server hosted on the 
Rasperry PI, which in turn controls the coffee machine via GPIO pins. To be
precise, the goal is to create a simple UI that controls the coffee machine the way it should.
If time is generous, we will then try to implement communication with a database and
maybe some more features on the mobile app.

\subsection{Communication between FLASK and App}
The machine will be hosting it's own web server that the user application will
be communicating with. It will have a REST API that will allow us to control the
board, and in turn the machine as well. Within the android application itself,
we can use a class called Java.net. Within that class we will be able to use
things such as HttpURLConnection to send HTTP requests such as GET and POST
requests. For Java HTTP GET requests we can get all the info we need in a
browser URL. We can use static functions or functions with parameters within
that URL. An example of a GET request would be something like: \\ \\
\textbf{http://localhost:8080/CoffeeMaker/login?userName=Jim}\\ \\which could
be a request for the user information on a user named "Jim". We could also send
out information in a POST request that would be received on the local server
and then interpret the information and perform an action. There are also other
actions that are useful in REST API's such as PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Steps
below are ones that would be used to send HTTP requests to the server using the
HttpURLConnection class:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a URL object with a GET/POST URL string like one mentioned above
\item Open a connection with that URL that creates an instance of an HttpURLConnection
\item Set the request method in the HttpURLConnection
\item Call setRequestProperty() on HttpURLConnection
\item Call getResponseCode() to see if the request was processed successfully or
if there were errors
\item For GET, use a Reader and InputStream and process the response
\item For POST, before reading the response, get an OutputStream from
HttpURLConnection and write POST parameters into it.
\end{itemize} 
\ \\

\indent\textbf{The Flask API exposed calls} \\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item The first API call will be to verify that it is connected, this call will
be a GET call to verify connectivity. If the call succeeds a 200 response will
be posted as well as the session number, UTC timestamp, and model of the
machine in a json formatted payload.

\item The second API call will be to initiate a brewing cycle. 
This will be a POST call with machine settings embedded in the url or in a payload sent. If the
call succeeds a 201 response will be posted as well as session number, utc
timestamp, model and the data that was interpreted. If the machine is currently
making a cup of coffee, it will respond with a 200 response that indicates that
the machine is busy and the order will either be queued or discarded.
\end{itemize}

The REST API will be exposed to anyone on the network as it will run on host
'0.0.0.0'. '0.0.0.0' is a non-routable address that allows all IPV4 addresses
on the network to be listened to on the Raspberry Pi operating system.
However, each request will not be accepted by the machine unless it has a
serialized key that matches the machine data. Each machine will come with a
unique serial number that must be included in each request in order for the
request to be accepted. This will validate that a request is intentional and
legitimate.
The flask application will control and log every request made, as well as push
every coffee call up to an external database, making it the only device that is
pushing up to the database.

 In the case that we cannot complete the project the database element will be
scratched. This would affect the Flask part of the project such that the
expectation of data pushing and pulling will not be implemented.
If time does not permit us to complete the database section in whole, then the database loses all 
of its importance to this project and thus should not be attempted.

In the case that we cannot demonstrate our project at the University of Utah due to network protections,
we would buy / bring a popup wifi-network that we could connect to.

\subsubsection{UI Skeleton}
For the user interface, we aim to setup something simple for a user, then if we
have more time, we will try to integrate a database into the machine that would
effect the mobile app as well. For the first part of this section, the focus will be
on what we aim to accomplish. The rest of the section will be on the database
stretch goal skeleton. The mobile application will not be too complex and will
probably consist of only a few activities in an Android Application. As usual
for many UI applications, we will be using a Model View Controller (MVC)     
concept.  Android studio can be nice, because it is completely possible to have
the model and controller in one section and the view in XML or another class
file that would most likely implement a canvas. Functionality is the first
objective, so an XML View, and Model/Controller activity class would probably
be the simplest form for a few activities.

For the main activity, the idea is to have a very simple main title screen
with a single button. As usual with all widgets, we we have listeners that will
react to an action on them. This button will most likely say "connect", which
will then open a new activity, or if already connected to a device that is
recognized as one of our machines, the application will skip the second
activity and go straight to the brewing portion of our application. 
If the mobile device had never been connected to the machine, the first
activity would take you to the next activity on a "connect" button push that
would let you connect to wireless access points around you (just as you
normally would connect to wifi). The list of wireless access points will most
likely be in a recycler view (basically a scrollable view with multiple
entities) One of those access points will be the Raspberry PI's, and once that
recycler view card is tapped, a listener will fire and highlight the card,
letting the user know which one has been selected. There will also be a "back"
button that will always be usable and a "connect" button that will only be
usable once a card is selected. Once the "connect" button is selected, the
application will send out a request to that access point. If that device is one
of our coffee machines, it will send a specific message that will let the
mobile app know that it is the correct device and open the brewing activity.

In the brewing activity there will be many different widgets that control options
on the coffee machine. There are Spinners, Buttons, Sliders, Seekbars, etc. to control
the different mechanisms within the coffee machine. The different
mechanisms that will need control are temperatures of water/milk, PSI values for water/frothing,
amount of milk(ounces), amount of froth(percentage), what kind of syrup and how much, the amount of coffee, and the fineness
of coffee grounds. These will all be represented as integer values. Below is a mockup of the brewing activity:

%\subsection{Data Aggregation and Processing Overview}
% The application will store user registrations, favorites, and other data in a standard SQL database. This database may be hosted separately from the machine, and could potentially be on a cloud service provider. The server will be encapsulated in an application server. The application server provides a container that can manage the database and its communication with the user application. The REST protocol will be used to communicate with the application server. Code running inside the application server will translate JSON or XML objects sent by the user into Java objects. Mappers will be used to dynamically translate these objects into SQL statements to update the database. The database will posses a users, beverages, and favorite's table. The users table will store core user data: name, email, salted password hashes, etc. The beverages table will store all of the settings you would need to instruct the coffee maker to produce an exact drink. Each beverage and user table row has a unique UUID. Each favorites list row will be connected to a single user via the UUID. Finally, each row of the favorites list will store all of the UUIDs that are associated with that list. That way, when a user sends a REST protocol request to get all of the favorites list of a particular user, the mapper can generate a SELECT request to grab all the relevant lists from the favorites table and then use the uuids stored within those rows of the favorites table to grab the drinks associated with each list. All the aggregated data is then returned to the user via REST protocol. 
%The application will store machine data, and individual coffee customizations in a standard SQL database. 
%The database will be hosted on a cloud service provider (AmazonS3 or Firebase). Each machine will have it's own table for statistics on its own components to document wear and usage. 
%Coffee customizations will be in a global database table where it will store information about the individual customizations of the cup of coffee as well as the serialized number for the coffee machine, for
%ease in sorting through machine by machine usage.

% Include a discussion of how well the device works here
\section{Evaluation}
When we started this project we set out to make a perfect coffee machine that
could do it all. Brew, froth, grind, dispense, and even more. We quickly found,
however, that creating just an automatic tamper/brewer was months of work
in and of itself. We had to start scaling back our expectations pretty
quickly into the project. There were also some unexpected pitfalls throughout
the course of the project. Our custom PCB not working as expected set us back by
two weeks, at least. We had to scramble fast to come up with an alternate
solution.

Ultimately however, the result of our work is pretty functional and something
that we can really be proud of. We successfully designed and implemented a
frightenly complex machine with a complicated embedded system and an Android app, and it
all works toghether to actually make espresso, just like we wanted.

The tamping and brewing mechanism worked as designed after only two iterations
of the 3D printed parts. We sucessfully wrote code to acuratly move and home
stepper motors, and the machine continues to maintain its accuracy after
repeated runs. That is, the machine doesn't get knocked out of alignement after
a use or two. It will function indefinetly.

Comparing our machine to existing automatic espresso machines, our
implementation falls a little flat in comparision due to the complexity and
costs invloved with our machine. A standard home automatic espresso machine
costs somewhere between $1000 and $2000. If our machine were to be produced and
sold as is, it would likely cost twice that amount. Although we set out with a
final product in mind, this machine is a prototype. Additional work by a full
engineering team with substantial funding would be needed to take the machine to
a point where it could be a competive product. 

Our machine does, however, demonstrate that the espresso making process can be
automated in a way that mimics the way in which a human would manually produce
espresso.
